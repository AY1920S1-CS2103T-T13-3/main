== Introduction
This project portfolio briefly introduces the project, treasurerPro (tP), and showcases my contributions.

=== About the Team
Our team consists of five members. Four, including me, are Year 2 Computer Science Undergraduate students, and one is a
Year 4 Computer Engineering Undergraduate student.

=== About the Project
This project was created as part of the “CS2103T Software Engineering” module, a project-driven software engineering
module offered by the National University of Singapore (NUS). We were tasked with the assignment of morphing or
enhancing an existing desktop application called AddressBook over the course of 13 weeks and chose the former. I am
proud to present to you the end result of our hard work – treasurerPro.

=== About the Product
treasurerPro is a desktop application that enables treasurers or members of Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) clubs to
manage their club’s finances, members’ details, reimbursements, and inventory, as well as oversee their financial
growth and long-term goals. It can operate entirely using text commands typed into the command box found at the top of
the application.

This is the application’s appearance when first opened:

As seen from the above Figure, the application has 6 tabs with unique roles. All tabs are integrated. The 6 tabs are:

** The Home tab, which keeps track of all transactions made.
** The Members tab, which records all of the club members’ details.
** The Reimbursements tab, which keeps track of all reimbursements that must be made to individual members.
** The Inventory tab, which keeps track of all items bought by the club.
** The Cashier tab, which simulates a cash register and supports the management of sales.
** The Overview tab, which presents a summary of the data of the other tabs in easy-to-decipher diagrams and allows you
to plan the club’s finances.

== Summary of Contributions
My role was to design and write the code for the Inventory tab. This section will describe my contributions in greater
detail.

=== Main Contributions
* Addition, Deletion and Editing of Items
** Function: These features allow you to add, delete and update the items in the inventory tab.
** Justification: These features are essential for the proper management of items in the inventory. They allow you to
have full control of the details of the items owned by the club.
** Highlights: When adding an item with the same description, the quantity of the new input is added to the current
quantity and the cost per unit is recalculated appropriately.
* Sorting of Items
** Function: This feature allows you to sort the list of items in 3 distinct ways – description, category and quantity.
** Justification: It aids you in re-ordering the list as you please. This can help you with various matters such as
spotting items low in quantity and in need of restocking.
** Highlights: If you change your mind, the `sort reset` command allows you to revert the list to the order it was in
when the application was first opened.

=== Other Contributions
* Documentation:
* Community:
** Helped to fix teammates' test cases.
** Cleaned checkstyle errors in other teammates' packages.
