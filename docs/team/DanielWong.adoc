== Introduction

This document serves as a project portfolio for treasurerPro, and outlines my contributions to the project,
including the features that I have implemented.

=== About the team

My team of five consists of four Year 2 Computer Science students, including me, and a Year 4 Computer Engineering
student, all taking the module CS2103T Software Engineering.

=== About the project

This project was developed as part of the module CS2103T Software Engineering. We were tasked to develop a desktop
application (Windows/macOS/Linux) with a Command Line Interface (that is, the program operates via text input from the
user, called commands). Additionally, we were required to use an existing application, called AddressBook Level 3, as
the starting point for building our application.

My team decided to create an application that would help treasurers of Co-Curriculur Activities (CCAs) and student
clubs track their expenses, reimbursements, sales and inventory. To do so, we incorporated the existing people
management features of AddressBook and used it as a starting point to build treasurerPro. We also built a new User
Interface (UI) to accommodate the new features that we had added.

In total, treasurerPro took a total of 8 weeks to complete.

=== Introduction of treasurerPro

The User Interface of treasurerPro is primarily divided into 6 tabs - Home, Members, Reimbursements, Inventory, Cashier
and Overview. Each tab serves a particular function:

. The Home tab lists all transactions
. The Members tab holds information of all the club's members
. The Reimbursements tab keeps track of outstanding reimbursements
. The Inventory tab keeps track of items owned by the club
. The Overview tab shows summary statistics of the club's finances

Additionally, there are two common elements across all tabs. The command box, for users to input their
commands, and Leo, the mascot of treasurerPro, who acts as a personal assistant and guides the user.

The following screenshot shows the User Interface of the application on first launch:

== Summary of contributions
I served as Team Lead for the project, and my responsibilities included the design of the new User Interface, as well
as the features within the Overview tab.

In the following sections, I will illustrate the above-mentioned enhancements in greater detail, along with the
corresponding documentation that I have written for them within the user and developer guides.

=== Enhancements and new features added
The following describes the enhancements and new features that I added to the project.

. New User Interface (UI)
** What it does: The new UI allows for each tab to effectively display its relevant data and interact with the user.
** Justification: The current AddressBook Level 3 (AB3) UI was unsuitable due to the multitude of new features within
each tab that have been implemented. As such, we decided to design a brand new UI that could fully represent the
features of treasurerPro.
** Highlights: The UI was made with SceneBuilder, an application built specifically for designing UIs. It retains AB3's
command box, but replaces the bulk of the application with a `TabPane` that houses the content for each tab. +
Additionally, a `GridPane` was used to create space for Leo, our mascot and personal assistant, to interact with the
user.

. Set and Notify Commands in Overview tab
** What it does: The set and notify command allow the user to set goals for their expenditure, budget and sales revenue,
and be notified when a percentage threshold of the goal has been met.
** Justification: These commands work together in tandem to form the basis of treasurerPro's financial planning feature.
They allow the treasurer to stay updated and continually keep track of the club's current financial health.
** Highlights: Each notification displays only once per app run, unless the goals or percentage thresholds are modified.
This prevents the user from being overwhelmed by excessive messages from treasurerPro.

. Summary statistics view in Overview tab
** What it does: The summary statistics view in the Overview tab allows the treasurer to monitor and take note of his
club's financial health with just a quick glance.
** Justification: It is tedious to flip through tab by tab, and read each table record by record just to gather summary
data about the current financial status of the club.
** Highlights: The calculations in this feature were implemented using Java Streams. This allows for future, similar
statistics to easily be added, simply by changing the criteria used when processing of the stream.
