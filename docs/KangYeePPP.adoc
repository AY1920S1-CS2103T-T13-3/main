This project portfolio briefly introduces the project, treasurerPro and outlines my contributions to the project
and explains the feature I implemented.

== Introduction

=== About the team

My team consists of 5 software engineering students under the module CS2103T. 4 of us, including me, are year 2
Computer Science students and the other is a year 4 Computer Engineering student.

=== About the project

This project is part of the module Software Engineering Project, CS2103T where we were tasked to develop a basic
command line interface desktop application by morphing or enhancing an existing AddressBook desktop application.
Our team decided to incorporate and morph the AddressBook application as part of our all-in-one application which
enables treasurers or members of Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Clubs and Societies to manage their club finances,
reimbursements to members, inventory and member’s contact details easily.

=== Introduction of treasurerPro

This desktop application consists of 6 tabs, a command box for users to input their commands and a response box
for Leo, our lion mascot. Each tab serves a different purpose that helps treasurers and members better manage their club
or Society's finances. The home tab keeps track of individual transactions. The members tab keep track of all contact
details of members. The reimbursement tab keeps track of reimbursement records for members that have spent for the club.
The inventory tab keeps track of items for sale. The cashier tab is a convenient way for the club or society to do
cashiering duties which helps to directly input sales into the system. The overview tab allows treasurers to plan the
club or society's finances.

This is what our application looks like when it is first opened. (graphical user interface for treasurerPro):

== Summary of contributions
My role was to design and write the codes for the Home Tab features. The following sections illustrate these
enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides in
relation to these enhancements.

=== Enhancements
I added the enhancements of the different commands for the Home Tab. The basic create, read, update and delete (CRUD)
commands were added.

==== Add, Delete and Edit Commands

* What it does:
It allows the user to create, delete and edit transactions. It also allows the application to restore data from
previous usage of the application

* Justification:
It forms the fundamental features required for the Home Tab to be useful for users to keep track of transactions

* Highlights:
These commands help to store and keep track of transactions in the Home Tab but also help keep track of sales
transactions from the Cashier Tab. The transactions are also tabulated by members that require reimbursement in the
Reimbursement Tab.

==== Sort Command

A sort command was also implemented for the transactions in the table to sort the commands to a certain order.

* What it does:
The addition of transactions requires the user to input the date, description, category, amount of money and
person accountable for each transaction. Thus, the sort helps to sort the transactions by the alphabetical order of
the person's name, by the date (from oldest to most recent) or amount (from largest to smallest).

* Justification:
It is useful for users to keep track of transactions and look at the transaction records according to different
priority.

* Highlights:
This command can be extended easily to allow for sorting of transactions in the reverse order.

==== Find Command

A find command was also implemented to help find specific transactions that match the keywords inputted by the user.

* What it does:
The find command allows user to filter out the transactions to only show those that match the keywords from all
the transactions recorded.

* Justification:
This allows users to easily find and filter out transactions to call another command to manage the transactions
better.

==== Go and Exit Command

Lastly, a go command and exit command was implemented to help navigate to another tab and leave the application.

* What it does:
The go command helps the user to navigate to another tab without having to click on the tab and the exit command allows
the user to leave the application without having to click on the window's icon as well.

* Justification: This ensures the application is a command-line interface application which requires no clicking
at all.
