== Introduction

treasurerPro (tP) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their club expenses*.
More importantly, tP is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, tP can get your expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

These are commands available within the command box for all tabs.

* Navigation between tabs:
Command: `go /TAB`

Allows you to navigate between tabs

* `go home`
* `go inventory`
* `go reimbursement`
* `go cashier`
* `go overview`

== Feature Specific Commands

These are commands that are specific to each feature which would be categorised into tabs in our application.

=== Home

====
* Home tab shows the transaction history of each expenditure.
* The columns will show the date/time of the transaction, description of the expenditure, category it is under, amount spent and the person who bought it.
* At the side, our mascot lion 'Leo' will help to give replies to indicate successful addition, deletion, edits of the command line input.
* He will also give you replies when there is a wrong input.
* There is a function to sort the transactions by date so from latest to oldest, person so by alphabetical order of the person and amount so from most to least.
* The amount should be inputted as positive if the transaction is considered revenue and adds to the club or society's reserves
and the amount should be inputted as negative if the transaction is a spending.
====

* To add a transaction:
`add dt/DATE_AND_TIME d/DESCRIPTION c/CATEGORY a/AMOUNT p/PERSON`

Examples:
`add dt/January 1st 2019, 07:00PM d/Printer ink c/Miscellaneous a/3.50 p/Janelle`


If the added transaction is negative which indicates a spending, it will be shown in the Reimbursement Tab as a pending reimbursement
record for the member that spent it. If there is an existing reimbursement record for that member still pending, the amount
of the newly added transaction will be added to the existing pending reimbursement amount.

* To delete an expense:
`delete INDEX` or `delete p/PERSON`

Examples:
** `delete 1`
** `delete p/Alex Yeoh`

* To edit a transaction:
`edit INDEX dt/DATE d/DESCRIPTION c/CATEGORY a/AMOUNT p/PERSON`

[NOTE]
The fields above can vary and be in different order. It is not compulsory to include all of them.

Examples:
** `edit 1 p/Bernice Yu dt/23-Aug-2019`
** `edit 3 a/12`

If the transaction intended to be deleted still has a pending reimbursement record, there will be an error response shown
and the deletion will not be allowed until the reimbursement record is marked as done.

* To sort:
** By date: `sort date`
** By person: `sort person`
** By amount: `sort amount`

The sort by date command will allow the user to view the table of transactions from the oldest to most recent.
The sort by person command will allow the user to view the table of transactions in alphabetical order.
The sort by amount command will allow the user to view the table of transactions from the one with the largest amount to the smallest amount.

* To un-sort:
`sort reset`

This command will allow the user to view the table of transactions in the order of when the current session of this application was just opened.


* To find:
`find KEYWORDS`

[NOTE]
The keyword can be one or more words. An entire keyword must match a word in the transaction intended to be found to be shown in the table
after the command. If the keyword is just a part of the word in the transaction, the transaction will not be shown in the table after the
command is inputted.

Examples:

** `find Alex Yeoh`
** `find Alex`

=== Reimbursements
The reimbursement tab displays all the reimbursements the treasurer needs to pay to people.
Each reimbursement contains a person's name, the total amount the person needs to be reimbursed,
description of the transactions related to the person and deadline for that reimbursement.

The reimbursement records are automatically extracted from transactions history with negative amount of money.
And each person only has one aggregated reimbursement in the reimbursement list.
All the reimbursements in reimbursement tab have not been done. Once the reimbursement is done,
that reimbursement record will not be displayed.

A user can add deadline to a reimbursement, find a reimbursement by providing the person's name,
let the app display full list, mark a reimbursement as done and sort reimbursement lists.

==== Adding deadline to a reimbursement: `deadline p/[name] dt/dd-mmm-yyyy`
This command helps to add a deadline to a reimbursement for the person.

.Diagram of deadline command in reimbursement tab

Otherwise, Leo in the right box shows response that the person is not in reimbursement list.

.Diagram of successful deadline command in reimbursement tab
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementDeadlineCommandSuccess.png[]

[NOTE]
The deadline date provided should be in the format of `dd-mmm-yyyy` e.g. `19-Dec-2019`.
If you provide an invalid form e.g. `01-AAA-2019` or `19-DEC-2019` or `-1-Dec-2019`,
Leo will remind you that the date is invalid.
In another case, if you input an invalid date e.g. `31-Feb-2019`,
our app helps to round it to `28-Feb-2019` and adds this deadline.

[NOTE]
If you want to modify the deadline for a reimbursement, you can use `deadline` command again
to reassign deadline to a reimbursement.

==== Finding a reimbursement for a person: `find p/[name]`

* To key in an item, it must first be recorded in the Inventory tab.
* The columns will show the description of the item being sold, the price per quantity, the total quantity selected
and the subtotal of that row of items.
* The bottom row will display the name of the cashier who is in-charge of the sales, as well as the total amount of all
the sales items in the table.
* At the side, just like other tabs, our mascot lion 'Leo' will reply to indicate successful addition, deletion,
edits of items.

====

* *To add an item being sold:*
`add [c/CATEGORY] d/DESCRIPTION q/QUANTITY`

The quantity of the item inputted must be not greater than the available stock in the inventory. Else, Leo will display
a message prompting input of a smaller quantity or another item.

The category field is optional. If you are unsure about the description of the desired item, you can refer to
the Inventory tab or simply key in the category without the any other fields. Leo will display all the items in the
specified category that are available for sale.

Additionally, if a word is mistyped or does not match any of the items in the inventory, Leo will recommend
some possible item descriptions you might be looking for.

[NOTE]
If both category and description are specified and valid, the system will allow the item to be added according the
description even if the category of the item does not match with the specified category inputted.

Examples:

* *To edit the quantity of an item that already exists on the table:*
`edit d/DESCRIPTION q/QUANTITY` OR `edit i/INDEX q/QUANTITY`

There are 2 ways to edit an existing item - by its description or index according to the table.

1. If you edit by index, the index must be a positive and be within the size of the table.

2. If you edit by description, the specified description must already exist in the table.

In addition, the quantity inputted should not exceed the available stock in the inventory.
If the quantity is invalid, Leo will display the quantity of stock left.

The person to be set as the cashier must be an existing member of the club. This means that his/her details must be
recorded via the Members tab and his/her name must be found on the Members tab. If you have yet to record the cashier
as a member, go to Members tab to register him as a member before executing this command.

[NOTE]
This step must be executed before checking out. Else, checkout cannot proceed.

** cashier David Li -> Sets David Li as a cashier



* *To checkout all the sales item:*
`checkout AMOUNT_PAID_BY_CUSTOMER`

The amount inputted is the amount that the customer will be paying. This amount must be greater than or equal to the
total amount listed on the bottom row of the table. If the amount paid is greater than the total amount, Leo will display
the amount of change that the cashier should return. +
After checking out, all items in the table will be cleared and the cashier and total amount will be reset.

[NOTE]
Cashier must be set before checking out.
