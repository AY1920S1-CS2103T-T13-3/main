== Introduction

treasurerPro (tP) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their club expenses*.
More importantly, tP is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, tP can get your expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
