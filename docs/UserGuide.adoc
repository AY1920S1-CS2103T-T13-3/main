== Introduction

treasurerPro (tP) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their club expenses*.
More importantly, tP is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, tP can get your expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Interested?
Let's move on to <<Quick Start>> to get started.
Enjoy!

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
. Download the latest `treasurerPro.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your treasurerPro.
. Double-click the file to start the app.
The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
. Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`go members`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will take you to the Members tab.

. Refer to <<Features>> for details of commands for each tab.

[[Features]]
== Features
This section contains details on the features in the treasurerPro.
These features are divided primarily into two categories:

* Universal commands available within all tabs
* Commands specific within each tab

Universal commands are displayed first. Tab-specific commands are organised according to the
tabs that they belong to.

====
*General Command Format Tabs*

* Highlighted words, like `add n/John Doe` or `add n/NAME` indicate that they can be entered into the Command Box.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

== Universal Commands For All Tabs

These are commands available for use in the Command Box for all tabs.

=== Navigation between tabs
Command: `go TAB`

This command allows you to navigate between tabs.

* `go home`
* `go members`
* `go inventory`
* `go reimbursements`
* `go cashier`
* `go overview`

Alternatively, you may also choose to click the tabs to switch to them.

=== Exit the application
Command: `exit`

This command allows you to exit the application immediately.
Alternatively, you may also click the `x` button on the top right (for Windows/Linux) or
top left (for macOS) to close the application.

== Application Tab Specific Commands

These are commands that are specific to each tab within treasurerPro.

=== Home Tab
This section will contain details on all commands available in the Home tab.

====
*Summary of features in the Home Tab*

* The Home Tab shows a list of all transactions made thus far.
* Each column shows the date, description, category, amount spent and the person responsible for each transaction.
* You may add, delete or edit transactions within this tab.
* Leo, our mascot, helps give replies indicating successful addition, deletion and edit of the a transaction
after a command has been input
* Leo will also give replies to guide you when there is a wrong input.
* You may also sort the list of transactions by descending date, by ascending alphabetical order or descending amount.
* The amount input for a transaction should be positive if the transaction is considered revenue to the club (that is,
it adds money to the club's funds).
* The amount input should be negative if the transaction is an expenditure made by the club (that is, it deducts money
from the club's funds).

[WARNING]
There is a limitation to the amount that you may enter which would be -999999.99 to 999999.
====

==== To Add a Transaction in the Home Tab
This command allows you to add a transaction to the table and saves it into the system.

* Command:
`add dt/DATE d/DESCRIPTION c/CATEGORY a/AMOUNT p/PERSON`

* Example
** [blue]`add dt/24-Aug-2019 d/Printer ink c/Miscellaneous a/3.50 p/Alex Yeoh`

[NOTE]
The format of the date has to be in dd-MMM-yyyy format. (Eg. 24-Aug-2019 or 03-Sep-2019)
The person must be someone recorded in the Members Tab and is case-sensitive.

[WARNING]
If you are adding a transaction meant to represent sales revenue, the transaction *must* be positive-valued
and under the "Sales" category for it to show up in the Overview Tab correctly.
If you are adding a transaction that is considered a spending which requires reimbursement to the member, the transaction *must* be negative-valued for it
to show up in the Reimbursements Tab.

* Steps

1. Type the command with all parameters filled in, as shown in the screenshot below:

//.Screenshot of the user input into the Command Box for Add Command in Home Tab
image::homeUG/HomeAddStep1cr.png[]

[start = 2]
2. Hit `Enter`.

If the command is successfully added, Leo will respond with a success message and the transaction
will be shown in the table. This is shown in the screenshot below:

//.Screenshot of a successful user input for Add Command in Home Tab
image::homeUG/HomeAddStep2cr.png[]


[[NoSuchPerson]]
If the person's name does not exactly match a current member in the Members Tab, Leo will respond with an error and the transaction
record will not be added.

[NOTE]
In addition, there is no character limitations to
the description or category entered. If the words are truncated, the columns in the table can be expanded by dragging the
right border of the column. Just be careful not to resize the column too much that it exceeds the window which would require
closing treasurerPro to restore back to original. Alternatively, you may click on the row to have the full details of the
transaction displayed as
a response from Leo.

////
This is shown in the screenshot below:

.Screenshot of an unsuccessful user input for Add Command in the Home Tab due to an invalid name

image::homeUG/HomeAddUnsuccessfulStep2cr.png[]
////

After step 2, if the added transaction contains a negative amount (indicating an expenditure), a corresponding entry will
automatically be shown in the Reimbursement Tab, tagged to the member who spent it.
Since reimbursements are aggregated by member, if the member already has other outstanding reimbursements,
it will simply be added to his existing row. This is shown in the screenshot below:

//.Screenshot of the Reimbursement Tab after successfully adding a transaction
image::homeUG/HomeAddShowInR.png[width = "400"]


==== To Delete Transaction(s) in the Home Tab
This command allows you to delete either all transactions of a person or a single transaction of a specific ID from the table.

* Command
`delete ID` or `delete p/PERSON`

* Examples
** Delete by ID: [blue]`delete 1`
** Delete by Person: [blue]`delete p/Alex Yeoh`

* Steps for Deleting by ID:
1. Type the command with the ID of the transaction to be deleted as shown in the screenshot below:

//.Screenshot of the user input into Command Box for Delete by ID command in Home tab
image::homeUG/HomeDeleteStep1cr.png[]


[start = 2]
2. Hit `Enter`.

Leo will respond with a success message and the transaction will be removed from the table as shown below:

.Screenshot of a successful user input for Delete by ID Command in Home Tab
image::homeUG/HomeDeleteStep2cr.png[]


* Steps for Deleting by Person:
1. Type the command with the person's name to delete all transactions related to that person, as shown in the screenshot below:


//.Screenshot of a user input into Command Box for Delete by ID command in Home Tab
image::homeUG/HomeDeletePStep1cr.png[]

[start = 2]
2. Hit `Enter`.

Leo will respond with the success message and the transaction(s) will be removed from the table as shown below:

//.Screenshot of a successful user input for Delete by Person Command in Home Tab
image::homeUG/HomeDeletePStep2cr.png[]

For both delete commands, if the transaction(s) deleted was part of a pending reimbursement record, it will also be removed from that
reimbursement record. On the other hand, if the person entered is not part of our database as shown in the Members Tab,
Leo will respond with a message to inform you.
////
as shown in the screenshot below:

image::homeUG/HomeAddUnsuccessfulStep2cr.png[width = "500"]
////
If the person does not have any transactions, Leo will also respond with a message to inform you.

==== To Edit a Transaction in the Home Tab
This command allows you to edit an existing transaction in the table and change its details.

* Command:
`edit ID dt/DATE d/DESCRIPTION c/CATEGORY a/AMOUNT p/PERSON`

[NOTE]
The fields above can vary in their order. It is not compulsory to include all of them but you need to
include at least one.

* Examples:
** [blue]`edit 1 p/Bernice Yu dt/23-Aug-2019`
** [blue]`edit 3 a/12`

* Steps:
1. Type the command with the ID of the transaction to be edited, along with the new parameters to be changed, as shown in the screenshot below:

//.Screenshot of user input into Command Box for Edit Command in Home Tab
image::homeUG/HomeEditStep1cr.png[]

[start = 2]
2. Hit `Enter`.

Leo will respond with a success message and the updated transaction will be shown in the table as shown below:

//.Screenshot of a successful user input for Edit Command in Home Tab
image::homeUG/HomeEditStep2cr.png[]


If the person entered into the command is not found in the Members tab, Leo will respond to inform you which is similar to <<NoSuchPerson, Add Command>>.

==== To Sort Transactions in the Home Tab
This command enables you to sort the table of transactions into a specified order for viewing and carrying out of subsequent commands.

* To sort:
** By date (from oldest to most recent): [blue]`sort date`
** By name (from alphabetical order of name): [blue]`sort name`
** By amount (from smallest to largest in amount): [blue]`sort amount`
** Undo sort: [blue]`sort reset`

[NOTE]
The undo sort command allows you to view the table of transactions in the order originally shown when the application was initially opened.

[[findCommandHome]]
==== To Find Transactions that Match Keywords in the Home Tab
This command transactions matching the specified keywords for viewing and for carrying out of subsequent commands,
based on the filtered table of transactions shown.

* Command:
`find KEYWORDS`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `alex` will match `Alex`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Alex Yeoh` will match `Yeoh Alex`
* Only the date, person, description, category of the transaction can be searched for.
* Only full words (no whitespaces) will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`, `24-Aug` will not match `24-Aug-2019`
* Transactions matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
****

* Examples:
** [blue]`find Alex Yeoh`
** [blue]`find Alex`

* Steps:

Shown below is the table of all transactions:

//.Screenshot of all transactions in Home tab

and sort the reimbursements.

* All reimbursements shown in the Reimbursement Tab are outstanding and have not been paid. Completed reimbursements will not be displayed.

====

[NOTE]
Reimbursements constitute only transactions resulting in an outflow of cash. This is represented by a negative amount
in a transaction, and means that the person tagged to that transaction had paid first, and needs to be reimburesd
for their expenditure.

==== Adding Deadline to a Reimbursement:

This command allows you to add a deadline to a person's reimbursement.

[WARNING]
You can set the deadline as any day you want. It is your responsibility to set a reasonable deadline.
