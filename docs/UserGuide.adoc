== Introduction

treasurerPro (tP) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their club expenses*.
More importantly, tP is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, tP can get your expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

. Refer to <<Features>> for details of commands for each tab.

[[Features]]
== Features
This section contains details on the features in the treasurerPro.
These features are divided primarily into two categories:

* Universal commands available within all tabs
* Commands specific within each tab

Universal commands are displayed first. Tab-specific commands are organised according to the
tabs that they belong to.

====
*General Command Format Tabs*

* Highlighted words, like `add n/John Doe` or `add n/NAME` indicate that they can be entered into the Command Box.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

== Universal Commands For All Tabs

These are commands available for use in the Command Box for all tabs.

=== Navigation between tabs
Command: `go TAB`

This command allows you to navigate between tabs.

* `go home`
* `go inventory`
* `go reimbursement`
* `go cashier`
* `go overview`

Alternatively, you may also choose to click the tabs to switch to them.

=== Exit the application
Command: `exit`

This command allows you to exit the application immediately.
Alternatively, you may also click the `x` button on the top right (for Windows/Linux) or
top left (for macOS) to close the application.

== Application Tab Specific Commands

These are commands that are specific to each tab within treasurerPro.

=== Home Tab
This section will contain details on all commands available in the Home tab.

====
*Summary of features in the Home Tab*

* The Home Tab shows a list of all transactions made thus far.
* Each column shows the date, description, category, amount spent and the person responsible for each transaction.
* You may add, delete or edit transactions within this tab.
* Leo, our mascot, helps give replies indicating successful addition, deletion and edit of the a transaction
after a command has been input
* Leo will also give replies to guide you when there is a wrong input.
* You may also sort the list of transactions by descending date, by ascending alphabetical order or descending amount.
* The amount input for a transaction should be positive if the transaction is considered revenue to the club (that is,
it adds money to the club's funds).
* The amount input should be negative if the transaction is an expenditure made by the club (that is, it deducts money
from the club's funds).

[WARNING]
Do not key in a quantity where the total amount in table or subtotal of that row exceeds 2,147,483,647, the range
of an integer. If it exceeds this number, please key in a smaller quantity or checkout items separately. +
You are advised to key in a number smaller than 10000 due to size limitation.
====

==== Add a Transaction
This command adds a transaction to the table and saves it into the system.

* Command:
`add dt/DATE d/DESCRIPTION c/CATEGORY a/AMOUNT p/PERSON`

* Example:
`add dt/24-Aug-2019, 07:00PM d/Printer ink c/Miscellaneous a/3.50 p/Janelle`

.Screenshot of the user input into the Command Box for Add Command in Home Tab
image::homeUG/HomeAddStep1.png[]

[start = 2]
2. Hit `Enter`.

If the command is successfully added, Leo will respond with a success message and the transaction

[[NoSuchPerson]]
If the person's name does not exactly match a current member in the Members Tab, Leo will respond with an error and the transaction
record will not be added. This is shown in the screenshot below:

.Screenshot of an unsuccessful user input for Add Command in the Home Tab due to an invalid name
image::homeUG/HomeAddUnsuccessfulStep2.png[]

If the added transaction contains a negative amount (indicating an expenditure), a corresponding entry will
automatically be shown in the Reimbursement Tab, tagged to the member who spent it.

Since reimbursements are aggregated by member, if the member already has other outstanding reimbursements,
it will simply be added to his existing row. This is shown in the screenshot below:

based on the filtered table of transactions shown.

* Command:

=== Reimbursements Tab

====
*Summary of features in the Reimbursement Tab*

* The reimbursement tab displays all the reimbursements that need to be paid out by the treasurer.

* Each reimbursement contains:
** The person's name
** The total amount the person needs to be reimbursed
** The description of the transactions related to the person and deadline for that reimbursement.

* Reimbursement records are automatically extracted from the transactions history.

[WARNING]
Do not key in a quantity where the total amount in table or subtotal of that row exceeds 2,147,483,647, the range
of an integer. If it exceeds this number, please key in a smaller quantity or checkout items separately. +
You are advised to key in a number smaller than 10000 due to size limitation.

====

[NOTE]
Reimbursements constitute only transactions resulting in an outflow of cash. This is represented by a negative amount
in a transaction, and means that the person tagged to that transaction had paid first, and needs to be reimburesd
for their expenditure.

==== Adding Deadline to a Reimbursement:

image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementDeadlineCommandSuccess.png[]

[NOTE]
The deadline provided should be in the format `dd-mmm-yyyy` e.g. `19-Dec-2019`. +
If an invalid format is input, e.g. `01-AAA-2019` or `19-DEC-2019` or `-1-Dec-2019`,
Leo will inform you that the input is invalid. +
If an invalid is entered, e.g. `31-Feb-2019`, the app will round it  to `28-Feb-2019`
