== Introduction

treasurerPro (tP) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their club expenses*.
More importantly, tP is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, tP can get your expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

These are commands available within the command box for all tabs.

* Navigation between tabs:
Command: `go /TAB`

Allows you to navigate between tabs

* `go home`
* `go inventory`
* `go reimbursement`
* `go cashier`
* `go overview`

== Feature Specific Commands

These are commands that are specific to each feature which would be categorised into tabs in our application.

=== Home

====
* Home tab shows the transaction history of each expenditure.
* The columns will show the date/time of the transaction, description of the expenditure, category it is under, amount spent and the person who bought it.
* At the side, our mascot lion 'Leo' will help to give replies to indicate successful addition, deletion, edits of the command line input.
* He will also give you replies when there is a wrong input.
* There is a function to sort the transactions by date so from latest to oldest, person so by alphabetical order of the person and amount so from most to least.
* The amount should be inputted as positive if the transaction is considered revenue and adds to the club or society's reserves
and the amount should be inputted as negative if the transaction is a spending.
====

* To add a transaction:
`add dt/DATE_AND_TIME d/DESCRIPTION c/CATEGORY a/AMOUNT p/PERSON`

Examples:
`add dt/January 1st 2019, 07:00PM d/Printer ink c/Miscellaneous a/3.50 p/Janelle`


If the added transaction is negative which indicates a spending, it will be shown in the Reimbursement Tab as a pending reimbursement
record for the member that spent it. If there is an existing reimbursement record for that member still pending, the amount
of the newly added transaction will be added to the existing pending reimbursement amount.

* To delete an expense:
`delete INDEX` or `delete p/PERSON`

Examples:
** `delete 1`
** `delete p/Alex Yeoh`

* To edit a transaction:
`edit INDEX dt/DATE d/DESCRIPTION c/CATEGORY a/AMOUNT p/PERSON`

[NOTE]
The fields above can vary and be in different order. It is not compulsory to include all of them.

Examples:
** `edit 1 p/Bernice Yu dt/23-Aug-2019`
** `edit 3 a/12`

If the transaction intended to be deleted still has a pending reimbursement record, there will be an error response shown
and the deletion will not be allowed until the reimbursement record is marked as done.

* To sort:
** By date: `sort date`
** By person: `sort person`
** By amount: `sort amount`

The sort by date command will allow the user to view the table of transactions from the oldest to most recent.
The sort by person command will allow the user to view the table of transactions in alphabetical order.
The sort by amount command will allow the user to view the table of transactions from the one with the largest amount to the smallest amount.

* To un-sort:
`sort reset`

This command will allow the user to view the table of transactions in the order of when the current session of this application was just opened.


* To find:
`find KEYWORDS`

[NOTE]
The keyword can be one or more words. An entire keyword must match a word in the transaction intended to be found to be shown in the table
after the command. If the keyword is just a part of the word in the transaction, the transaction will not be shown in the table after the
command is inputted.

Examples:

** `find Alex Yeoh`
** `find Alex`

=== Reimbursements
The reimbursement tab displays all the reimbursements the treasurer needs to pay to people.
Each reimbursement contains a person's name, the total amount the person needs to be reimbursed,
description of the transactions related to the person and deadline for that reimbursement.

The reimbursement records are automatically extracted from transactions history.
And each person only has one aggregated reimbursement in the reimbursement list.
All the reimbursements in reimbursement tab have not been done. Once the reimbursement is done,
that reimbursement record will not be displayed.

[[Note]]
The reimbursements only count the outflow transactions. When a transaction has negative amount, it means
the person in that transaction pays for the CCA first and you need to reimburse the person for the expense.

A user can add deadline to a reimbursement, find a reimbursement by providing the person's name,
let the app display full list, mark a reimbursement as done and sort reimbursement lists.

==== Adding deadline to a reimbursement: `deadline p/[name] dt/dd-mmm-yyyy`
This command helps to add a deadline to a reimbursement for the person.

[start = 2]
. The tab will show the added deadline for the reimbursement if the person appears in reimbursement.
Otherwise, Leo in the right box shows response that the person is not in reimbursement list.

image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementDeadlineCommandSuccess.png[]

[NOTE]
The deadline date provided should be in the format of `dd-mmm-yyyy` e.g. `19-Dec-2019`.
If you provide an invalid form e.g. `01-AAA-2019` or `19-DEC-2019` or `-1-Dec-2019`,
Leo will remind you that the date is invalid.
In another case, if you input an invalid date e.g. `31-Feb-2019`,
our app helps to round it to `28-Feb-2019` and adds this deadline.

[NOTE]
If you want to modify the deadline for a reimbursement, you can use `deadline` command again
to reassign deadline to a reimbursement.

==== Finding a reimbursement for a person: `find p/[name]`
This command helps to find out the reimbursement for the person.

====
