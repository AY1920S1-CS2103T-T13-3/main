== Introduction

treasurerPro (tP) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their club expenses*.
More importantly, tP is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, tP can get your expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Features
This section will contain the details on the features the application. These features include the universal commands available for all tabs and
commands specific for each tab. The commands are organised according to the tabs that they can be used in.

====
*General Command Format Tabs*

* Words highlighted like `add n/John Doe` or `add n/NAME` indicate that those can be entered into the Command Box.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

====

==== Add a Transaction to the Table
This command helps to add a transaction record into the table and to be saved into the system.

* Command format:
`add dt/DATE d/DESCRIPTION c/CATEGORY a/AMOUNT p/PERSON`

Examples:
`add dt/24-Aug-2019, 07:00PM d/Printer ink c/Miscellaneous a/3.50 p/Janelle`

[NOTE]
The format of the date has to be in dd-MMM-yyyy format. (Eg. 24-Aug-2019 or 03-Sep-2019)

* Steps:

1. Type the command with all the parameters filled in as shown in the screenshot below:

.Screenshot of user input into command box for add command in Home tab
image::homeUG/HomeAddStep1.png[]

[start = 2]
2. Enter the command.

If the command is successfully added, there will be a response from Leo and the transaction record
will be shown in the table. This is shown in the screenshot below:

.Screenshot of successful user input for add command in Home tab
image::homeUG/HomeAddStep2.png[]

[[NoSuchPerson]]
If the person's name is not someone in the Members tab then there will be a response from Leo and the transaction
record will not be added. This is shown in the screenshot below:

.Screenshot of unsuccessful user input for add command in Home tab due to invalid person's name input
image::homeUG/HomeAddUnsuccessfulStep2.png[]

If the added transaction has a negative amount which indicates a spending, it will be shown in the Reimbursement Tab as a pending reimbursement
record for the member that spent it. If there is an existing reimbursement record for that member still pending, the amount
of the newly added transaction will be added to the existing pending reimbursement amount. This is shown in the screenshot below:

.Screenshot of Reimbursement tab after successfully adding transactions
image::homeUG/HomeAddShowInR.png[]

This command helps to edit an existing transaction record in a table with different parameters.

* Command Format:
`edit ID dt/DATE d/DESCRIPTION c/CATEGORY a/AMOUNT p/PERSON`

[NOTE]
The fields above can vary and be in different order. It is not compulsory to include all of them.

.Screenshot of successful user input for edit command in Home tab
image::homeUG/HomeEditStep2.png[]

If the person entered into the command is not found in the Members tab, Leo will respond to inform you which is similar to <<NoSuchPerson, Figure 3>>.

==== Sort Transactions in the Table
This command helps to sort the table of transactions into specific orders for viewing and for carrying out subsequent commands.

* To sort:
** By date (from oldest to most recent): `sort date`
** By name (alphabetical order of name): `sort person`
** By amount (from most to least in amount): `sort amount`
** Undo sort: `sort reset`
[NOTE]
The undo sort command will allow the user to view the table of transactions in the order of when the current session of this application was just opened,
not when the transactions was first entered.


==== Find Transactions that Match Keywords:
This command helps to find transactions that match the entered keywords for viewing and for subsequent commands to be inputted based
on the filtered table of transactions shown.

* Command Format:
`find KEYWORDS`

[NOTE]
The keyword can be one or more words. An entire keyword must match a word in any of the parameters of the transaction intended to be found and shown in the table.
If the keyword is just a part of the word in the transaction, the transaction will not be shown in the table after the
command is inputted.

* Examples:
** `find Alex Yeoh`
** `find Alex`

* Steps:
Shown below is the table of all transactions:

.Screenshot of all transactions in Home tab
image::homeUG/HomeFindCurr.png[]

1. Type the command with keyword(s) to find transactions as shown in the screenshot below:

.Screenshot of user input into command box for find command in Home tab
image::homeUG/HomeFindStep1.png[]

[start = 2]
2. Enter the command.
Leo will respond with the number of matching transactions to the keywords and the table will only show the filtered
transactions matching the keywords. This is shown in the screenshot below:

.Screenshot of successful user input for find command in Home tab
image::homeUG/HomeFindStep2.png[]

[start = 3]
3. Enter `back` to return to the table of all transactions or enter your next command to be executed. The edit command
being inputted as the next command can be shown in the screenshot below:

.Screenshot of user input for edit command according to filtered table's ID in Home tab
image::homeUG/HomeFindStep3.png[]

The table will continue to show the filtered table with the transaction edited according to the command shown in the screenshot above.
[NOTE]
For the add command, the table will automatically show the full list of all transactions. The rest of the commands will
require the user to input `back` to return to the full list of all transactions.

The screenshot below shows the table after entering `back` which shows all the transactions in the table again:

.Screenshot of user input for back command after entering find command in Home tab
image::homeUG/HomeFindStep3Back.png[]

=== Reimbursements Tab
The reimbursement tab displays all the reimbursements the treasurer needs to pay to people.
Each reimbursement contains a person's name, the total amount the person needs to be reimbursed,
description of the transactions related to the person and deadline for that reimbursement.

The reimbursement records are automatically extracted from transactions history.
And each person only has one aggregated reimbursement in the reimbursement list.
All the reimbursements in reimbursement tab have not been done. Once the reimbursement is done,
that reimbursement record will not be displayed.

[NOTE]
The reimbursements only count the outflow transactions. When a transaction has negative amount, it means
the person in that transaction pays for the CCA first and you need to reimburse the person for the expense.

A user can add deadline to a reimbursement, find a reimbursement by providing the person's name,
let the app display full list, mark a reimbursement as done and sort reimbursement lists.

==== Adding deadline to a reimbursement: `deadline p/[name] dt/dd-mmm-yyyy`
This command helps to add a deadline to a reimbursement for the person.

.Diagram of deadline command in reimbursement tab
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementDeadlineCommand.png[]

[start = 2]
. The tab will show the added deadline for the reimbursement if the person appears in reimbursement.
Otherwise, Leo in the right box shows response that the person is not in reimbursement list.

.Diagram of successful deadline command in reimbursement tab
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementDeadlineCommandSuccess.png[]

[NOTE]
The deadline date provided should be in the format of `dd-mmm-yyyy` e.g. `19-Dec-2019`.
If you provide an invalid form e.g. `01-AAA-2019` or `19-DEC-2019` or `-1-Dec-2019`,
Leo will remind you that the date is invalid.
In another case, if you input an invalid date e.g. `31-Feb-2019`,
our app helps to round it to `28-Feb-2019` and adds this deadline.

[NOTE]
If you want to modify the deadline for a reimbursement, you can use `deadline` command again
to reassign deadline to a reimbursement.

==== Finding a reimbursement for a person: `find p/[name]`
This command helps to find out the reimbursement for the person.

. Type `find p/[name]` into command box and press `enter` to execute it. e.g. `find p/Bernice Yu`
